  - All formatted in Indonesian locale (dots as thousands separator)

When: User approves a new transaction (Expense: 100k)
Then:
  - Total Balance updates to "1.600.000" within 500ms
  - Expense card updates to "300.000"
  - No page refresh (uses Zustand update)
```

**Test Case**:

3. Verify redirected to /auth
4. Verify cannot navigate back to /transactions without signing in again
5. Sign in again → all previous data restored (from backend)

---

## 6. Notification Listener Service (THE USP) – Secure-Sync Architecture

### AC 6.1: Headless Task – App Allowlist

```gherkin
Given: Notification arrives from an app
When: System triggers headless NotificationService.ts
Then:
  - Task extracts app name from notification
  - Checks if app matches ALLOWED_APPS_REGEX:
    /jago|gojek|gopay|ovo\.id|id\.dana|shopee|bankbkemobile|seabank|sea\.bank|com\.bca|mybca|mandiri|livin|brimo|id\.co\.bri|src\.com\.bni|mewallet|linkaja/i

If MATCH:
  - Continue to parsing logic

If NO MATCH:
  - Task exits (no confirmation sent)
  - Notification ignored
```

**Test Case**:

1. Send notification with app name "com.gojek" → Should match (includes 'gojek')
2. Send notification with app name "com.whatsapp" → Should NOT match
3. Send notification with app name "id.dana" → Should match (exact match)

---

### AC 6.2: Headless Task – Amount Filtering

```gherkin
Given: Notification from allowed app
When: Headless task parses title + text
Then:
  - Looks for amount pattern: Regex /(?:rp\.?|idr)\s*[\d.,]+/i or /sebesar\s+[\d.,]+/i

If AMOUNT FOUND:
  - Continue to OTP/login filter

If NO AMOUNT:
  - Task exits (probably just a login notification)
  - No confirmation sent
```

**Test Cases**:

1. Notification: "GoPay - Rp 50.000 debit dari akun Anda" → Should find amount ✓
2. Notification: "Selamat datang di GoPay" (no amount) → Should skip ✗
3. Notification: "Sebesar 100000 dikirim ke" → Should find amount ✓

---

### AC 6.3: Headless Task – OTP & Login Alert Filter

```gherkin
Given: Amount found in notification
When: Headless task checks content for OTP/login patterns
Then:
  - Checks if text contains: 'otp', 'kode verifikasi', 'verification code', 'login baru', 'masuk dari', 'perangkat baru'

If OTP/LOGIN FOUND:
  - Task exits, no confirmation sent

If NONE FOUND:
  - Continue to save-as-pending step
```

**Test Cases**:

1. "Kode OTP Anda: 123456" → Should skip (contains 'otp') ✗
2. "Masuk dari perangkat baru di Jakarta" → Should skip ✗
3. "Rp 50.000 transferred" → Should proceed ✓

---

### AC 6.4: Secure-Sync – Headless Saves to SecureStore (No API Call)

````gherkin
Given: Notification passes all filters (amount, not OTP/login)
When: Headless task completes parsing
Then:
  - Task saves parsed data as "Pending" record in SecureStore:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "uuid-xxx",
      "app": "gopay",
      "title": "GoPay Debit",
      "text": "Rp 50.000 debit",
      "amount": 50000,
      "timestamp": 1711270800000,
      "status": "pending"
    }
    ```
  - Task triggers LOCAL push notification to user:
    ```
    Title: "GoPay"
    Body: "Confirm Rp 50.000 debit?"
    Action: "Open App"
    ```
  - Task EXITS – Does NOT call backend API

When: App is NOT open:
  - Pending record stays in SecureStore (persisted)
  - Local push remains in notification center

When: User taps the local push notification:
  - App launches/resumes
````

**Test Case**:

1. Kill app completely
2. Send test notification from GoPay: "Rp 100.000 debit"
3. Verify local push appears in notification center
4. Inspect SecureStore: Verify pending record was created
5. Verify NO API call was made to backend
6. Tap push notification → app launches

---

### AC 6.5: Foreground Sync – App Checks Pending Records

```gherkin
Given: App launches or comes to foreground
When: App initializes (useAuthStore checks token, ForegroundSyncService activates)
Then:
  - Foreground Sync checks SecureStore for pending transactions
  - Retrieves all pending records

If pending records exist:
  - App navigates user to /transactions/confirm screen
  - Passes first pending record to confirmation screen

If NO pending records:
  - App continues normal flow to /transactions list
```

**Test Case**:

1. Kill app
2. Receive notification, verify pending record created in SecureStore
3. Reopen app → should auto-navigate to /transactions/confirm
4. Verify first pending record displayed

---

### AC 6.6: Confirmation Screen – User Verification & Category Assignment

````gherkin
Given: App shows /transactions/confirm screen with pending record
When: Screen renders
Then:
  - Display parsed data (READ-ONLY):
    * App name: "GoPay"
    * Amount: "Rp 50.000"
    * Date & Time: "23 March 2024, 14:30"
    * Original notification text: "GoPay debit dari kartu kredit"

  - Display editable fields:
    * Wallet: Dropdown with auto-detected wallet (user can change)
    * Category: EMPTY (required, user must assign) — NOT pre-filled
    * Note: Optional text field

  - Buttons at bottom:
    * "Confirm" (only enabled when category selected)
    * "Skip"

When: User selects a different wallet
Then:
  - Dropdown updates immediately

When: User selects category (e.g., "Transport")
Then:
  - "Confirm" button becomes enabled

When: User taps "Confirm"
Then:
  - Form validates (category required)
  - API call: POST /transactions with:
    ```json
    {
      "walletId": 1,
      "amount": 50000,
      "transactionType": "Expense",
      "category": "Transport",
      "date": "2024-03-23",
      "time": "14:30",
      "note": "GoPay debit dari kartu kredit",
      "importSource": "notification"
    }
    ```
  - On success:
    * Transaction created
    * Delete pending record from SecureStore
    * Show toast: "Transaction confirmed"
    * Navigate back to /transactions (transaction visible in list)

When: User taps "Skip"
Then:
  - Pending record deleted from SecureStore
  - Navigate back to /transactions
  - No transaction created
````

**Test Case**:

1. Open app (or reopen if it was killed) with pending record
2. Confirmation screen appears
3. Verify amount, date, notification text displayed correctly
4. Try to tap "Confirm" without category → button disabled
5. Select category "Food"
6. Tap "Confirm"
7. Verify: API call succeeds, transaction appears in /transactions list
8. Verify: Pending record removed from SecureStore

---

### AC 6.7: Token Availability for Headless & Foreground Sync

```gherkin
Given: User signs in, app stores token in SecureStore
When: App is closed/killed
And: Notification arrives from supported app
Then:
  - Headless task runs (OS-level feature)
  - Headless task does NOT need token (it only parses & saves locally)
  - No token validation needed in headless context

When: App is reopened/resumed with pending records
And: Foreground Sync activates
Then:
  - Foreground Sync reads token from Zustand (useAuthStore)
  - Token available immediately
  - API calls to backend authenticated with token

If NO TOKEN (user logged out):
  - Foreground Sync recognizes user is not authenticated
  - Navigates to /auth instead of /transactions/confirm
  - User must sign in first before confirming transactions
```

**Test Case**:

1. Sign in user → token stored in SecureStore
2. Navigate /transactions → token read into Zustand
3. Kill app
4. Send test notification → pending record created (headless works without token)
5. Reopen app → Foreground Sync retrieves pending, uses token from Zustand
6. Confirmation screen appears with fully authenticated context
7. Confirm transaction → API succeeds

---

### AC 6.8: Notification Deduplication

```gherkin
Given: Same transaction notification sent twice within 5 minutes
When: First notification triggers headless parsing
And: Saved as pending record (uuid-1)
And: User opens app, sees confirmation screen, approves
And: Transaction created (txn-id: 123)
And: Pending record deleted from SecureStore
And: Second identical notification arrives
Then:
  - Headless task parses second notification
  - Saves as new pending record (uuid-2)
  - App opens confirmation screen again
  - User now sees two identical confirmations (unless backend deduplicates)

BACKEND DEDUPLICATION (future enhancement):
  - Backend checks for duplicate transaction within 5-minute window
  - If found: Rejects second submission with "duplicate_detected"
  - Frontend handles duplicate error gracefully
```

**Test Case**:

1. Send mock notification: "GoPay Rp 50.000"
2. Open app, confirm → transaction created (ID: 123)
3. Send identical notification again immediately
4. Verify second pending record created
5. Open confirmation screen → second offer appears
6. Approve second → Backend may reject or create second (depends on backend dedup logic)

---

### AC 6.9: Pending Record Cleanup

```gherkin
Given: Pending record in SecureStore
When: App checks pending records
And: Record is older than 24 hours
And: User has NOT confirmed or skipped
Then:
  - Foreground Sync auto-discards (removes from SecureStore)
  - No confirmation screen shown for expired record
  - Next pending record (if exists) shown instead
```

**Test Case**:

1. Manually create a pending record in SecureStore with outdated timestamp (>24 hours old)
2. Open app
3. Verify: Confirmation screen does NOT show the old pending record
4. Verify: Old record removed from SecureStore

---

## 7. Form Usage (Reusable Components)

### AC 7.1: TransactionForm Validation

```gherkin
Given: User on transaction create/edit form
When: User attempts to submit without filling required fields
Then:
  - Amount field: If 0 or empty → "Amount is required"
  - Category field: If unselected → "Category is required"
  - Wallet field: If unselected → "Wallet is required"
  - Date field: Auto-filled to today (always valid)

When: User fills all required fields
Then:
  - "Save Transaction" button becomes enabled (was disabled)

When: User taps Save
Then:
  - No validation errors
  - API call sent
  - On success: Form closes, user returns to list
  - On error: Error message shown (e.g., "Network error, please retry")
```

**Test Case**:

1. Open transaction form
2. Tap Save without entering anything
3. Verify validation errors appear
4. Fill in amount: 50000
5. Tap Save → error still shows (category missing)
6. Select category
7. Tap Save → success

---

### AC 7.2: WalletForm Validation

```gherkin
Given: User on wallet create/edit form
When: User attempts to submit with empty wallet name
Then:
  - Error below name field: "Wallet name is required"

When: User attempts to submit with invalid balance (non-numeric)
Then:
  - Error below balance field: "Balance must be a valid number"

When: User enters name "My Wallet" and balance "0"
Then:
  - Form allows submission (balance can be 0 for new wallets)
  - API call succeeds

When: User enters name with >50 characters
Then:
  - Error: "Wallet name must be 50 characters or less"
```

**Test Case**:

1. Open wallet form
2. Try to save empty form → errors appear
3. Enter name but leave balance blank
4. Try to save → error on balance
5. Enter balance "abc" (non-numeric)
6. Try to save → validation error
7. Enter valid data: name "Test", balance "1000000"
8. Save → success

## 8. Integration Tests

### AC 8.1: Full New User Flow (E2E)

```gherkin
Scenario: Complete onboarding from sign-in to first transaction approval

Given: Fresh install, app launches to /auth
When: User taps "Sign in with Google"
And: Completes Google OAuth
Then: Redirected to /onboarding/intro (new user detected by backend)

When: User taps "Get Started"
Then: Redirected to /onboarding/permissions

When: User grants notification permission
Then: Redirected to /onboarding/wallets

When: User selects 3 apps (GoPay, OVO, Dana) with balances
And: Taps "Continue"
Then:
  - All wallets created
  - Redirected to /transactions
  - Header shows aggregated balance

When: User receives transaction notification from GoPay
Then:
  - Confirmation push appears

When: User taps "APPROVE"
Then:
  - New transaction recorded in list
  - Balance updated
  - User sees notification in history

When: User navigates to /wallets
Then:
  - All 3 created wallets visible with correct balances

When: User navigates to /profile
Then:
  - User name + photo displayed
  - Notification toggle shows ON
  - Logout option available
```

**Execution**:

- Test on real Android device (Samsung A12+)
- Expected total time: <5 minutes end-to-end
- All screens should load smoothly without lag

---

### AC 8.2: Full Existing User Flow (E2E)

```gherkin
Scenario: Sign-in and resume with previous data

Given: User previously signed in, wallets + transactions exist
When: User signs out via /profile
And: Closes and reopens app
And: Signs in with same Google account
Then:
  - Redirected directly to /transactions (no onboarding)
  - Previous wallets visible in /wallets
  - Previous transactions visible in list
  - Balance aggregated correctly
```

**Execution**:

- Sign in new user → create wallets + transactions
- Sign out
- Kill app
- Reopen → sign in again
- Verify data restored

---

## 9. Performance & Load Tests

### AC 9.1: Transaction List Performance

```gherkin
Given: User with 1000+ transactions
When: Navigate to /transactions
Then:
  - List renders in <1 second
  - Scrolling smooth (60fps target)
  - No jank or frame drops

When: Scrolling to bottom
Then:
  - Pagination triggers
  - Next batch loads in <500ms
  - Smooth append to list
```

**Load Test**:

- Mock 1000 transactions in Zustand store
- Profile rendering time with React DevTools
- Target: List TTI <1s, scrolling smooth

---

### AC 9.2: API Response Time

```gherkin
Given: Any API call (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
When: Request sent
Then:
  - Response received in <500ms (p95)
  - Timeout after 10s (show error)
  - Retry logic on network error (max 3 retries)
```

**Test**:

- Monitor network tab during transactions
- Verify all responses <500ms
- Test timeout scenario (disable network → close app)

---

## 10. Security Tests

### AC 10.1: Token Expiration & Refresh

```gherkin
Given: User signed in with valid token
When: Token expires
Then:
  - Any API request receives 401 Unauthorized
  - App automatically signs out user
  - User redirected to /auth
  - Appropriate error message shown
```

**Test**:

- Sign in, note token
- Try to navigate to /transactions → should redirect to /auth

---

### AC 10.2: Secure Storage

```gherkin
Given: User signs in
When: Token stored in SecureStore
Then:
  - Token NOT visible in app files/logs
  - Token cleared on logout
```

**Test**:

- Inspect device storage: /data/data/com.tondikiandika.uangku/
- Verify no auth tokens in SharedPreferences
- Verify SecureStore uses encrypted storage (Android Keystore)
